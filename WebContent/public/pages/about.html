								</div>
							</div>
							<p>With the ever-changing economy shifting towards "on-demand" work, it is our goal to supplement the current admissions process with an enhanced organic way of  understanding the true feeling of the university. Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> connects high school students with real college students (our Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> mentors) from the top universities around the country.  Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> provides mentors that serve three goals:</p>

							<ol>
								<b><li>Help high school students find the perfect university:</li></b>
								<p>Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> mentors help provide mentorship and a better understanding of what the university life is really at any university. </p>

								<b><li>Help navigate the admissions process:</li></b>
								<p>Our Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> mentors will help guide high school students though the admissions process by giving them tips on college applications, college interviews, scholarships, financial aid and much more!</p>

								<b><li>Customized mentoring:</li></b>
								<p>If students have already found their top university or just want some guidance on how to grow personally, develop their skills or just be ready for college, Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> mentors can also provide customized mentoring to get the high school student prepared for everything college related.</p>
							</ol>

							<p>The Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> team feels for these students and understand that some life changes are best made with the guidance from someone who has been through it before. That's why Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> is aiming to solve these customer pain-points by giving them a REAL view of how that particular college is, without the glamour that comes from generic open houses. Students spend 10s of thousands on their education and with the right guidance, Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> mentors will help them make a right choice. </p>


							<p>Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span> wants to help every student get 1:1 guidance through the admission process, all while developing their goals, and other skills. There is a current gap in the market since the only way students can connect professionally with students at these university is through friends or generic open houses. Gur<span style="color:#B50000;font-weight:600;">U</span>'s vision is to fill this gap in a way that is benifitial for all parties invalided.</p>
